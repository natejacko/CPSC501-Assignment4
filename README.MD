CPSC 501 - Assignment 4: Welcome to TensorFlow

The following code base is for Assignment 4 offered in CPSC 501 by Jonathan Hudson at the University of Calgary.

The assignment description is as follows: The goal of this assignment is to explore three increasingly harder problems. The first is
to improve the logistic regression accuracy of the MNIST digit image model we
demonstrated in class. The second is to replace the MNIST image data with a harder set
of letter representation data and make a model for it. The third is to create and develop a
model for data loaded from a CSV file about Coronary Heart Disease and associated risk
factors.
